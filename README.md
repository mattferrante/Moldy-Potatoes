#Moldy Potatoes

“Moldy Potatoes” is a small website I created for Project
1 in the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program.  It is a website built using HTML and Python
to house cover-art and trailers for a few of my favorite movies. 

## What you should see

In the folder you should see, in addition to this file:

1. entertainment_center.py
2. media.py
3. fresh_tomatoes.py

## Browser configuration

In order for the website to work properly on your machine you will need to allow scripting and ActiveX controls

## How to view the site

Download the zip file of the branch master to your computer.  Once the file is downloaded you can access the website one of two ways

1. If you have Python installed as a valid path 
..* Open your comand prompt, navigate to the modly-potatoes foler and use the comand `python entertainment_center.py`.

2. If you are running from a shell like IDLE
..* Open the `entertainment_center.py` file and run or hit `F5` on your key board
