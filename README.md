#Moldy Potatoes

“Moldy Potatoes” is a small website I created for Project
1 in the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program.  It is a website built using HTML and Python
to house cover-art and trailers for a few of my favorite movies. 

## What you should see

In the folder you should see, in addition to this file:

1. entertainment_center.py
2. media.py
3. fresh_tomatoes.py
4. fresh_tomatoes.html

## Browser configuration

In order for the website to work properly on your machine you will need to allow scripting and ActiveX controls

## How to view the site

Download the zip file of the branch master to your computer and open **fresh_tomatoes.html** with your web browser.
