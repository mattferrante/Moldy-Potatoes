# Moldy-Potatoes
“Moldy Potatoes” is a small website I created for Project 1 in the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program.  It is a website built using HTML and Python to house cover-art and trailers for a few of my favorite movies. 

## What you should see 
In the folder you should see, in addition to this file:
1. entertainment_center.py
2. media.py3.
3. fresh_tomatoes.py
4. fresh_tomatoes.html 

## How it works  
Open fresh_tomatoes.html in a web browser to view the website.
